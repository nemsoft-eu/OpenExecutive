"""A single tool result must not be able to dominate a turn.

An unbounded result (a large document fetch) lands in the context and is
then re-sent on every remaining iteration of the tool loop, so one call
can cost more than the rest of the turn combined. `_cap_tool_result` is a
circuit breaker against that — deliberately set high enough that ordinary
tool output never reaches it.

The contract pinned here:
  1. under-limit results pass through byte-identically (the common case);
  2. an over-limit result is cut to within the budget, marker included;
  3. the marker names the tool, says the result is incomplete, and gives
     both character counts — silent truncation is worse than none, since
     the model reads the cut text as the whole answer;
  4. the limit comes from settings, not a literal;
  5. the cap sits DOWNSTREAM of the propose_form_values JSON parse, so an
     over-limit JSON result still produces its form_patch event. Capping
     at the producer instead would feed truncated JSON to json.loads and
     silently kill the SSE event.
