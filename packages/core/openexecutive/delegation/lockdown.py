"""Act as me: what a turn may not do once it has read the owner's own mail.

``ghostwrite_email`` and the reads of the owner's mailbox
(``search_my_email``, ``read_my_email``, ``read_my_email_attachment``,
``my_email_awaiting_reply``) put mail other people wrote in front of the
model. Text in it could try to steer the model ("open this link with the
invoices in it"). Most of what such text could want is already fenced on its
own: messages, invites and the Executive's own email reach only people on
the roster or addresses the speaker typed, an email written as them is only
a draft in their own mailbox until they send it themselves, facts and profile edits keep only
the speaker's words, and playbook changes wait for a person on the Playbooks
tab. What is not fenced is a door to the open internet. So from the round it
runs in until the turn ends, only that stays shut: no outside fetch (a URL
can carry what the mail said anywhere: ``read_document``, research, the
watchlist, ``load_mcp_server``, any gateway tool but
``PRIVATE_TURN_MCP_TOOLS``), no script or library job (it can reach either),
no workflow (it runs later, unattended, and may fetch or script), no post
to everyone (broadcasts, department messages, alerts), and no change to who
is on the roster or holds authority (archiving someone, a department head, a
roster request), since every send and approval check trusts it.

The one roster change that runs is a contact they named themselves in this
message (``speaker_named_contact``). Anything else they would want done goes
on an approval card instead of being refused outright (``propose_actions``):
the card is built in code and shows exactly what will happen, and only their
tap does it, which text in a mail can't give.

Every tool the Executive can be offered is classified here, in exactly one of
``MAIL_TOUCHED_ALLOWED_TOOLS`` or ``MAIL_TOUCHED_WITHHELD_TOOLS`` (a test fails
until a new tool is), and anything unclassified is withheld.

The dispatch guard in ``orchestrator.executive`` refuses a withheld call
without changing the offered tool list (the cached prefix stays the same all
turn), and treats a round that calls any of them as already touched,
because a round's tools run concurrently. The handlers that reach outside
check again (``outside_reach_refusal``). The server-side ``web_search``
stays, as on a turn private to the owner: it cannot be refused at dispatch
without a cache miss. The lockdown lasts for the turn
(``TurnDelegation.read_mail``) and no longer. A later turn of that
conversation stays private to its owner (``touched_mail``), and its history
carries only their words and the Executive's replies, never the mail a tool
returned: their next message is them asking again, having read the reply.
