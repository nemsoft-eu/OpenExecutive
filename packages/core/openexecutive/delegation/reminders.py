"""remind_me: a reminder sent to the person who asked, as plain text, when
it is due (``orchestrator.reminder_tools``).

Act as me's way to "remind me Friday" that is safe on a turn that read the
person's mail. ``schedule_followup`` is not: its row runs a whole Executive
turn with tools when it fires, and ``/scheduled`` shows it to everyone. A
reminder here:

- is stored as fixed text, cleaned once when it is set: one line, no links
  or addresses (a link in a DM is fetched for its preview, and the text may
  repeat something the mail planted), at most ``MAX_TEXT`` characters;
- goes only to the person who set it, through their own channel
  (``scheduler.runner.deliver_to_person``), never to anyone else;
- runs nothing when it fires: no model, no tool, the text as stored;
- is private: its own table, private audit rows, never on the activity rail.

The scheduler's tick claims each due reminder once before sending it
(``send_due``), so two workers never both send one and a send that failed
halfway is never repeated.
