"""The reply cards the inbox watcher leaves for a person (``delegation.inbox``).

``cards`` lists them for ``GET /delegation/replies`` from the database alone:
no Gmail call, so the Today page never waits on Google. ``dismiss`` runs after
a card is rejected (``DecisionClassSpec.after_reject`` for
``delegation_reply``): a draft nobody edited is deleted from their Gmail
Drafts; one they edited there stays. A draft is unedited when its message id
is still the one it was saved with (Gmail gives an edited draft a new one).
