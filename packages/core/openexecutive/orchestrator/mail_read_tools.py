"""Act as me: read the speaker's own mailbox from chat — ``search_my_email``,
``read_my_email``, ``read_my_email_attachment``, ``my_email_awaiting_reply``
and ``my_email_read_before`` (the threads ``read_my_email`` opened for them
before, ``delegation.mail_reads``: where, never what)
(Gmail or Outlook, through the same per-person credential ``ghostwrite_email``
uses).

They ride with ``ghostwrite_email`` in ``delegation_tools.DELEGATION_TOOLS``,
so they are fenced the same way:

- **Offered** only on a turn ``pin_turn_delegation`` offered Act as me to,
  never in ``_ALL_SKILL_TOOLS``; the handler re-checks the pin and the surface.
- **Private.** Before the first read each marks the turn as having read the
  owner's mail (``TurnDelegation.touched_mail`` and ``read_mail``): its audit rows are private,
  it teaches no memory, the conversation is theirs alone, and nothing that
  opens a link, runs a script or workflow, or posts to everyone runs for the rest
  of the turn (``delegation.lockdown``).
- **Read-only.** Nothing is changed, labelled, drafted or sent.
- **Capped per turn**: ``SEARCHES_PER_TURN`` searches, ``THREADS_PER_TURN``
  thread reads and ``ATTACHMENTS_PER_TURN`` attachment reads, each slot taken
  before the first await (a round's calls run concurrently).
- **Attachments are read, never kept.** A file's text comes back in an
  untrusted block, parsed in an isolated worker (``knowledge.loader``); unlike
  a file sent to the Executive, it is never added to the company knowledge.
- **Other people's words are data.** Each message someone else wrote comes
  back inside an ``<untrusted_content>`` block (``content_trust``); the
  speaker's own sent mail (``threads.mine``: SENT, from their address) is
  marked ``yours`` outside those blocks, where no sender can write.
