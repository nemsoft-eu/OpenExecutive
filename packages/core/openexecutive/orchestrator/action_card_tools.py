"""``propose_actions``: leave the person you are speaking with a card of
actions to approve with one tap (``delegation.action_cards``).

It rides with Act as me's tools (``delegation_tools.DELEGATION_TOOLS``), so it
is offered and re-checked the same way (``_writer``: the pin and the verified
surface). It opens no mailbox and does nothing itself, so it stays on after a
turn read mail, when ``message_person``, the calendar tools and roster writes
are withheld: that is what it is for. Nothing on the card happens until the
person approves it, signed in on the web: in the chat it was left in (its chip
carries the card's id) or on Today. The one exception is a card of actions
they allowed with Approve + allow, with Suggested actions in training
(``action_cards.run_on_its_own``). That card is usually proposed on a turn
that read untrusted mail, so a message it sends has model-written text
nobody reads first: the allowance covers who and what kind, not the words,
and the sensitive, link, amount and length checks and the daily cap are
what bound it.
