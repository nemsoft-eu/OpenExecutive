    An unresolved name used to be answered with a plain "Unknown specialist"
    string, so the turn looked like it consulted someone while consulting
    nobody — in one measured sample every consult in the turn was malformed.

    Two tolerances:
      - case-fold, since only the casing differs;
      - a prefix that matches exactly one registry key.

    A prefix matching several keys stays unresolved: guessing between `cso`
    and `coo` would route the question to the wrong executive, which is worse
    than not routing it at all.

    Uniqueness is a property of the CURRENT roster, not of the algorithm.
    Today `b` resolves to `board_comms` and `g` to `gc` because nothing else
    starts with those letters; adding a specialist would correctly turn those
    into None, and a key that is a prefix of another key would make the longer
    one unreachable by prefix. `test_no_registry_key_prefixes_another` pins
    the second case so the roster cannot drift into it silently.

    emitted 1,724 output tokens and took 58.7 s of generation on the local

    Each specialist receives its own domain-filtered RAG context, fetched
    in parallel before the LLM calls fire. Callers may still supply a
    pre-built ``retrieved_knowledge_map`` (keyed by specialist name) to
    short-circuit the per-call retrieval — useful for tests or when the
    caller has already gathered shared context.

    ``episodic_context`` is per-turn (not per-specialist) and forwarded to

    ``session_id`` (when provided) is threaded into the per-specialist
    department-memory prefetch for audit grouping. Specialists whose
    department has institutional Honcho memory receive a
    ``<department_memory>`` block synthesized from that dept peer's
    representation; specialists without an owning department (e.g.
