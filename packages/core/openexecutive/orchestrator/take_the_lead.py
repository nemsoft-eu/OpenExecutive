"""Take the lead: the Executive acts on its own, behind one gate.

Two switches, each off until someone turns it on:

- **As the Executive** (scope ``executive``, the principal's alone). The
  unattended passes (reflection, research, the scheduler's proactive trigger)
  keep the acting tools they otherwise lose in solo mode (booking, starting a
  workflow, messaging teammates and not just the principal), and every acting
  call they make goes through ``gate``.
- **As you** (scope ``person:<id>``). Handle it for me stops applying its
  Careful / Balanced / Bold limits to that person's replies and follow-ups;
  the gate's added rules apply instead (``reply_hit``), next to everything
  Handle it always keeps (signed sign-ins, exactly the thread's people,
  sensitive topics, one a thread, the daily limit).

**The gate** is plain code. Six kinds of action wait for someone first, each
with its own Ask first switch (all on to start): money, contracts, people
decisions, deleting or sharing, someone new, and big sends. On top of them
the company (set by the principal) and each person (for their own As you)
add rules: a person or address, a domain, words, or an amount. Added rules
always hold. A held action becomes a ``take_the_lead_action`` decision for
the person whose authority covers it (``people.store.find_approvers``, the
same scopes the department approval levels use), else the principal, with a
companion card on Today; approving it carries the exact call out
(``carry_out``) and declining drops it.

Pausing the Executive stops all of it: every pass above runs behind the
scheduler's pause gate. A person approving a held action is their own act,
so it works while paused.

Everything it does on its own is recorded in ``take_the_lead_log``; Recent
activity on Today names what it did (``api.routes.today._build_activity``).
