"""Chat tools and document collections an install adds without changing this code.

``OPENEXECUTIVE_EXTENSIONS`` names Python modules, comma-separated. Each has a
``register()`` that calls ``register_tool`` and ``register_collection``; they
are imported once, when the API starts (or the first time anything needs them
in a process that has no API, e.g. the CLI).

An extension tool is offered only on a turn someone is in:

- never on an unattended run: the scheduler's proactive trigger is refused
  here, and reflection and research build their toolkits from
  ``_ALL_SKILL_TOOLS``, which never holds these;
- never on a turn private to the principal (mail from one of their contacts);
- never to a speaker who isn't on the People list (mail from a stranger, an
  unknown chat user), so text from outside the team can't reach these tools;
- like every tool Act as me's lockdown has not classified, it is refused once
  the turn has read the owner's mail (``delegation.lockdown`` fails closed);
- and only where the tool's own ``offered(session)`` says so, which should
  depend only on the kind of turn (surface, workspace mode), never on what was
  said, so each kind of turn keeps one cached tool list.

A tool may sit in a ``tool_groups`` group (opened with open_tools) instead of
on the direct list, and may describe its chip. A collection is a kind of
document an extension publishes as a drafted artifact tagged
``collection_tag(name)``: the Documents page gives it its own filter, and the
extension hears when one is archived, restored or deleted, before it happens.
