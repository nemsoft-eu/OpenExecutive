"""Authority gate for department-scoped proactive actions.

The gate is consulted whenever a proactive action (scheduled or cadence)
has a department slug — it reads the department's authority_level and
decides whether the action should execute immediately, be proposed to an
approver, or be escalated to the principal.

All callers are expected to pass `now` explicitly so the gate is
deterministic and easy to test without time mocking.

    and future resolvers can filter/match without parsing the body;
    ``extra_tags`` lets a caller carry the originating alert's tags (e.g.
    a ``comp`` / ``legal`` marker) onto the proposal.

    ``external_id_suffix`` turns the card into a recurring one: an open
    (unread) card with the same dedup key is refreshed in place with the new
    body — whatever its suffix, so one situation never has two open cards —
    and once the person has acted on it a fresh card is minted only when
    the suffix changes (callers pass e.g. the ISO week). Without a suffix
    the proposal is one-shot and a repeat with the same summary is
    suppressed for good. Coalescing keeps the open card's routing: a head
    change re-routes it only once the current card has been handled.
