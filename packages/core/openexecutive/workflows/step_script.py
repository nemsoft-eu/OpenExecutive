"""Let a workflow action step act through one short script instead of many turns.

An action step's agent normally calls its tools one model turn at a time, so
"go through this Drive folder and file each document" costs a turn — tokens
and seconds — per file. ``run_script`` lets the agent write that loop once, in
Python, and get back only what the script returns.

The script runs in Monty (``pydantic-monty``), a sandboxed Python interpreter
for code a model wrote, in a worker process spawned per script (so no state
survives from one script to the next):

* **Nothing but the step's own tools.** A call to any function the script did
  not define pauses the worker and comes back here, where it is answered
  through the action step's own per-call path (``action_step._StepCalls.call``):
  the allowlist (a name outside it is refused and audited, like a direct
  ``tool_use``), the call budget, the first-write target check (a held write
  comes back to the script as the usual ``{"status": "held", …}`` result) and
  the audit row. A script is a faster way to make the same calls, never a way
  around them. There are no files, network, environment variables,
  subprocesses or third-party imports; OS calls get Monty's refusal.
* **Driven from the event loop.** The worker is stepped with ``feed_start`` /
  ``resume``, so each call is awaited in the step's own task: cancelling the
  run, or the wall clock below, stops the script and its in-flight call
  together, and the engine sees each call's events as it happens.
* **Bounded.** Execution time (not counting time waiting on tools), memory and
  recursion are capped inside the worker, the whole script has a wall-clock
  limit, and the script's text and printed output are size-capped (printing
  past the cap is dropped, not fatal).
* **Not stored.** The script lives only in this step's model turns, like any
  other tool call's arguments; a workflow definition still holds no code.

Monty supports a subset of Python (no classes with inheritance, no
third-party packages), which is enough for loops, conditions, string and
data handling over tool results.

    ``may_save`` is whether this context may save (or re-version) a tool:
    only the principal's own interactive chat turns. A saved tool runs with
    the authority of whoever runs it, so its author must be trusted at least
    as much as anyone who may run it — never an inbound email, a teammate, an
    unattended run or a workflow step reading outside content.
    ``may_run_saved`` is whether it may run one: a workflow step (the owner
    approved its tools) or the principal's own turn, never someone else's.

    ``tools`` is a workflow step's allowlist (None in chat). A saved tool runs
    in a step only when every tool it used is one of the step's; in chat the
    gateway checks each call as usual. With ``save_as``, a script that
    succeeds is saved (approved automatically — it can only ever act through
    whatever context runs it) with the tools it called. Yields like
    ``run_script``; never raises (cancellation aside).
