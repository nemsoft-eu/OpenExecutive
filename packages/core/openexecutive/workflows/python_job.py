"""Python jobs: library-heavy work on files (split a PDF, build a spreadsheet,
draw a chart) in a WebAssembly sandbox.

``run_script`` (Monty) decides what to do and calls the Executive's tools;
it can't run libraries. ``run_python_job`` is the workshop for that: Python
in Pyodide (WebAssembly) with a fixed, bundled set of libraries (pypdf,
openpyxl, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, Pillow, lxml, python-docx, python-pptx,
fpdf2, XlsxWriter), run by Deno in a process of its own per job.

**The sandbox is Deno, not Pyodide.** Pyodide's Python can call into its
JavaScript runtime, so under plain Node a job could read the server's
environment (API keys), its files and the network. Deno is started with read
access to the sandbox folder and the worker script only: no network, no
environment, no writes, no processes. Files go in on stdin and come back on
stdout, so the job never needs a file or network permission.

A job sees only what it is handed: files from the Knowledge library, named
by the caller; the files attached to the chat message being answered, as
sent (workflows/turn_files.py); text the caller passes; and ``inputs``.
Result files are kept for ``_KEEP_DAYS`` under the company folder and served
to the principal at ``GET /python-jobs/{job}/{file}``.

A job that worked can be kept as a Custom tool (``save_as``, a saved tool of
kind ``python``, workflows/saved_tools.py) and run again by name with new
``inputs`` and files, so a job done before costs no code-writing tokens.
Every job is metered: one ``python_job`` audit row with its time, CPU,
memory and bytes, which ``GET /audit/usage`` sums (``python_jobs``).

The sandbox is installed by the API image (``docker/Dockerfile``) under
``PYTHON_SANDBOX_DIR``; ``available()`` is false without it, and the tool
is then not offered.

A deployment can run jobs elsewhere instead: with ``PYTHON_JOB_RUNNER_URL``
set, ``run_job`` POSTs each job there (``_run_remote``) and reads back the
same result object the local worker prints, so files, caps, kept results and
metering work the same. The runner is trusted to isolate jobs as the local
sandbox does.
