"""Tables for Always in the loop (``memory.history``), in the episodic DB.

Per company, like the roster the notes are keyed on: they swap with a client
slot (``clients.slots._BLANK_WIPE_TABLES``) and a factory reset clears them
(``cli.fixture_loader``).

Kept free of imports so ``memory.episodic.initialize_db`` can create them
without an import cycle.
