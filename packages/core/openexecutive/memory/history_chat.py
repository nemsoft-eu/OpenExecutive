"""Always in the loop from chat: notes of what a person tells the Executive in
a chat where it knows it is them (``memory.history``).

After each chat turn (``Executive.stream_chat`` and the committee path), when
the speaker turned "Keep track of what happens" on, one tool-less pass reads
**only the words they typed this turn** (``delegation.settings.own_words``:
no quoted backstory an adapter added, nothing when an attachment came with
it) and writes at most three short dated notes of what they committed to,
decided, declined, answered or shared. Never what the Executive said, never
anyone else's message: every channel calls the Executive with the one
speaker's message, and what other people say to each other is never read.

Only from a speaker the turn verified (``verified_speaker``): the web chat
signed in (or a local install), the principal or a team member on their own
Slack or Discord, a private Telegram chat behind a valid webhook secret, or a
channel whose adapter vouched for the sender itself
(``Session.speaker_verified``). A shared thread counts too: the notes stay
private to the person, and are read back only where nobody else can see them
(``orchestrator.history_tools``).

The pass uses the same checks as notes from email (``history_notes.check_note``):
the quote is found word for word in what they typed, the summary adds no
figure, name or date word they didn't, no link or address. It is paced: a
message shorter than ``MIN_CHARS`` is skipped, and each person gets at most
``MAX_PASSES_PER_DAY`` passes a day, counted in the company DB.

``schedule_chat_notes`` is the one entry point. It never raises and logs
codes, never text.

questions or small talk. Most messages need no note at all.

something), declined, answered, asked (they asked another person for \
something), shared.
- summary: one short sentence in the third person, past tense, starting \
with a verb, never naming the assistant: "Said the Q4 price list goes to \
Dana Lee on Friday." Use only names, figures and dates that are in \
<chat_message>.
- quote: the exact words from the message the note rests on, copied \
character for character.
- due_date: YYYY-MM-DD only when they promised or agreed to something by a \
date the message states outright; otherwise leave it out.
