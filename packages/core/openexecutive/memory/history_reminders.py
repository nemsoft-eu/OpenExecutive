"""Always in the loop reminders: on the day something a person promised by
email falls due, by their own notes (``memory.history``), one short message
to them alone says so.

Only notes from replies they sent with Act as me
(``history.SOURCE_APPROVED_REPLY``): a promise they made in chat is already
an open loop the nudge engine chases when due (``attunement.open_loops``), so
reminding of it here too would say it twice.

The message names nothing from the notes, only how many things are due, and
the channel senders' audit rows for it are private to the person (the owner's
to the owner) and stay off the shared activity rail. The person asks for the detail in a conversation only they
can read, where ``recall_history`` answers (``orchestrator.history_tools``).
It goes to their own DM, Telegram chat or email address
(``scheduler.runner.deliver_to_person``), never a shared channel, at most once
a day (one try: a failed send waits for the next due day), during the
workspace's daytime.

The scheduler tick calls :func:`maybe_remind`. Never raises; logs codes,
never text.
