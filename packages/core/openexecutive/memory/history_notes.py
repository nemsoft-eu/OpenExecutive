"""The note-taker for Always in the loop (``memory.history``): turns a reply
someone approved and sent into at most three short dated notes of what they
told whom.

It reads **only the words the person sent** (quoted replies below them
stripped) and the names of who it went to, cut to a short name: never the
mail being answered, nor the subject (which others write too), so nothing
another person wrote can become a note. One forced tool
call (``record_notes``), no other tools, no memory, no company context, and a
constant prompt short enough that it isn't cached.

Code then checks every note before it is stored, and drops the ones that
fail:

- ``quote`` is the person's own words, found word for word in what they sent;
- ``summary`` adds nothing they didn't say: every figure is in the quote, and
  every name or date word is in what they sent or the recipients' names,
  and most of its other words are theirs too;
- no link or email address appears in the summary;
- ``kind`` is one of ``history.KINDS``, and ``due_date`` a real date (kept
  only for something promised or agreed).

``note_sent_reply`` is the one entry point (``delegation.reply_send`` calls it
after a send went through). It never raises and logs codes only.
