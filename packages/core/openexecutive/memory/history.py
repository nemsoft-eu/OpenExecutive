"""Always in the loop: dated notes of what happened, that the Executive can
recall later.

A note is an *event*, never an instruction: "Oct 3: told Dana Lee the Q4
price list comes Friday", with the exact words it came from (``quote``), when
it happened, where (``channel``, ``conversation_key``), who it was with
(``counterpart``) and how far it is trusted (``trust``). Code sets every one
of those but the summary; a model only writes that sentence, and the quote it
rests on is checked word for word before anything is stored
(``memory.history_notes``).

**What writes notes.** Two things, both reading only the person's own words,
so nothing another person wrote can become a note; that is their own word,
so ``trust`` is ``high``:

- a reply the Executive drafted in someone's own mailbox (Act as me), after
  that person approved and sent it (``delegation.reply_send`` →
  ``memory.history_notes``);
- what they say to the Executive in a chat where it knows it is them: the web
  chat signed in, their own Slack, Discord or Telegram, or any channel whose
  adapter verified the sender (``Session.speaker_verified``)
  (``memory.history_chat``). Messages between other people are never read.

**Who reads them.** A note's ``visibility`` is ``private``: its own person
alone, never the principal, and only in a conversation nobody else can read
(``orchestrator.history_tools``), even when it was noted in a shared thread. Each person sees, corrects, pins and
forgets their own notes in Memories → History (``/memories/history``).

**Switches.** Each person turns it on for themselves (``reply_notes``,
absent means off; despite the name it covers every channel). Any team member
on the People list may (``can_keep_notes``); notes from email replies still
need Act as me, which writes them. The owner sets how long notes last for the company
(``retention_days``: 30, 90, 365, or until forgotten; 90 when unset), and a
person may shorten it for their own notes, never lengthen it. A pinned note
never expires. "Don't remember this" forgets a conversation's notes and
keeps it from being noted again (``history_excluded``).

Every function here is per company (the episodic DB), never raises on a
read, and logs codes, never note text.
