What it's learned (``learned``: actions allowed in training, from a card or
a suggestion, with any edit kept as an example, then the owner's own Act as
me replies allowed with Send + allow) and what it suggests allowing
(``suggested``) come with the switch.

Changing anything that lets more happen on its own needs a request the API
can tie to the principal (signed sign-ins or local login, as Send does);
turning something off, or holding more back, does not.
